# GIT - A software that allows for tracking of changes in any file, for the most part code, and coordinates changes on the files/code among several people.

# GITHUB - A company that not only is a repository for GIT, but one that is easily accessible. It is collaborative, accessible through your browser, and for the most part used for hosting code.

# Repository - A location where data and files are stored. In this case, the data stored especially concerns and has relation to your project. 

# Clone - A clone is a downloaded copy of a repository copying all of the code 1:1 from the repository.

# Commit - A commit is a revision or update to a file(s). However, what is special about a commit is that previous versions are recorded with what was changed, notes of what was changed, when it was changed, and who changed it.

# Push - A push is when content stored locally on a machine is uploaded to a remote repository (like GITHUB)

# Pull - A pull has a similar function to push. However, information is pulled from the remote repository and downloaded to the local machine/repository to update it.

# Branch - Branches in GIT are a "duplication", allowing change/edit code without having an effect on the main code, in a sense isolating work. This can be useful for merging content and other versions in the future. 

# Merge - Merge does exactly what it sounds like. It takes several branches of independent code and puts them together into one branch.

# Merge Conflict - A merge conflict is the occurrence when the differences in code cannot be resolved by GIT automatically, and a merge does not occur.

# Fetch - A fetch is when information is downloaded from the remote repository into a local repository. However, as opposed to a pull where everything is downloaded including the files and source code, a fetch takes in information about specifically changes that were made. Not the actually changed content.

# Remote - A remote, or remote repository, is a collaborative repository that several people can use to exchange and view each other's changes.
